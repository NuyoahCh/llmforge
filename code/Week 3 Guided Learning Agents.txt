Title: Agents

This lecture examines the design and operation of agents, with emphasis on workflows, tool use, and multi-step reasoning methods. We cover agent orchestration, tool execution, planning strategies, multi-agent systems, and evaluation practices.

Learning Objectives:

Distinguish between agents, agentic systems, and LLMs, and understand levels of agency

Learn workflow techniques such as prompt chaining, routing, parallelization, reflection, and orchestration-worker setups

Study tool integration, including tool calling, formatting, execution, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Explore multi-step reasoning frameworks (ReACT, Reflexion, ReWOO, tree search) and challenges in multi-agent systems

Review evaluation strategies for measuring agent performance and reliability
