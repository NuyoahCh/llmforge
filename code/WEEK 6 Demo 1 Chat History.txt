How much is the cost
00:27:44	Milosz G:	Replying to "AI Travel Agent for ..."

For the interest and hotel profiles, you can add a simple drop down for preference, not really asking user too many question because it makes it too much work for the user.
Similarly like we had different prompt expansion for image/ video in multi-modal project - in your case if user picks affordable prefference then you add prompt “Focus on lower price” similar for activities you would have “Outdoor” - focus on mostly outdoor activities near by”.

Q. Can you share what prompt did you use?
00:28:08	Harpreet S:	If you ask a follow up question  give me further breakdown of California  etc
00:28:39	Harpreet S:	Like the UI
00:29:31	Harpreet S:	Is the Chat Memory Manager hand coded or a library?
00:30:35	Yichi Zhang:	Replying to "Do you see hallucina..."

For hotels and flights no, since they come from Google via Serp API. 

For the itinerary, AFAIK not really, but we could increase reliability by changing the prompt output to maybe a JSON schema and using self-consistency prompting (running the prompt multiple times).

00:40:25	Siddartha Thota:	Replying to "@Yichi Zhang Are you..."

Generally in enterprise systems, we need to create these metadata information. But just for the MVP purpose, I created the meta-data using LLM and then added few additional details on what I feel LLM missed and fine-tuned my LLM prompt to make sure in the next run it remembers it.

I manually created tables in the .sql file, but LLM goes over these schemas before generating the schema metadata. 

In real world, we’ll have DAO files, so may be we can build an agent for GIT to fetch all the DAO files and build 1 schema metadata file ourselves instead of LLM doing this for us.
00:42:26	Anthony Stanislaus:	Reacted to "Both frontend and ba..." with 👍
00:43:19	Yichi Zhang:	Replying to "@Yichi Zhang Are you..."

Since LLMs are probabilistic by nature, there are no guarantees. There are multiple techniques in the industry. 

For example, we can run the prompts multiple times, or use chain of thought
00:43:35	Ikee:	Reacted to "Since LLMs are proba..." with 👍
00:44:41	Siddartha Thota:	Yeah totally agree. I just moved into a new team at work and for production access we have a tooling for which we needed to convert sql/mongo queries into the tooling json format. 

I was planning on taking this project to fetch the sql/mongo queries -> build the json format for the tooling. That’s how I got this idea, I was initially trying out a different project (git code review) -> which I ran into multiple issues.

I’ve provided LLM the structure I want it to generate and also LLM is not 100% the first few times, I kept enhancing my prompt and added critical information to make sure it creates right schema metadata the next time. 

For enterprise purposes -> I feel we can use Cursor/Windsurf and fetch all DAO files and create the schema metadata information and pass that info again to LLM to add more crucial information to that data and double verify it 🙂

I didn’t use MCP in this project for now. 

I’ve been building MCP servers at work to expose our tools to agents. 

In this current project, If I’m using it for enterprise, we  can definitely use MCPs exposed to fetch info, or read schema and other crucial information
00:53:35	Prathamesh Bongale:	Replying to "3. Agentic AI Career..."

Sure Ravi, we can collaborate and take it further
00:53:45	Roy Seto:	Replying to "we had also earthqua..."

I grew up in Cupertino, the hometown of Apple (when it was still full of apricot orchards and before Jobs founded Apple). We lived next to the San Andreas fault. I usually sleep through earthquakes unless they’re really strong. 

Don’t know if my learned adaptation is evolutionarily helpful or not 😉

I was doing a batch job balancing LLM timeout along with feeding limited data for now. Ingesting about 1500’ish records took about few minutes for which I didn’t run into any DB related issues. 

In enterprise systems, we might not be ingesting the data, but just fetch.

01:31:59	Roy Seto:	I’ve learned so much from @Ali Aminian  and all of you—this cohort has been gold!

To help us stay connected and keep the momentum going, I created a private unlisted LinkedIn group for ByteByteAI Cohort 1 (Oct–Nov 2025):

https://www.linkedin.com/groups/16265002/

Let’s use it to share AI learnings, job leads, and project ideas, and to support each other as builders curious about all the exciting innovations and opportunities happening now.

For now, anyone with the link can join directly (no admin approval needed). You’re welcome to invite others from our cohort, but please don’t share the link outside the group.

I’ll switch it to approval-only after the first wave of signups settles.

02:02:20	Ikee:	@Shitalkumar Sawant Maybe you already mentioned it but I didn’t hear it. Could you improve the correctness and accuracy of your tool by using multiple LLMs and use their aggregate results to flag for non-compliance data?

02:03:16	Ravi:	Replying to "@Shitalkumar Sawant ..."

Will be great add, as with compliance you want to be as accurate as possible for your compliance results and comparisons.

Couple of things to keep an eye out with multiple LLMs is 
1) Latency of querying multiple
2) Cost
3) how to decide which output is correct

02:05:33	Shitalkumar Sawant:	Replying to "@Shitalkumar Sawant ..."

That’s a good suggestion @Ikee 

I can experiment and use two models:

One to identify attributes and another one to use attributes as an input to identify the regulation.

The alternative is to fan out request to multiple models and determine which model is the most confident.

Did you have any other idea?

02:21:19	Ikee:	Replying to "@Shitalkumar Sawant ..."

@Shitalkumar Sawant Not at this time. Will share with you as new ideas arise. If I were you, I would test by using more than 2 models due to the level of accuracy the results need to be. It’s like how many “9” of accuracy your tool can gurantee. I would focus on accuracy before optimizing the tool to have acceptably low latency.
02:22:56	Prasad:	@Bhanu Anishetty  - Great idea and presentation. And the Quiz questions are Tougher than I thought 🙂 ! Can you prompt your way through the LLM to generate easier questions . 😄

Maybe as a cohort, we could have regularly scheduled demo sessions. I’m in the process of scheduling a zoom with Roy Seto to discuss the management of the private LN group he created. I’ll add this topic to my discussion with him, in terms of who and how to handle the logistics of scheduling and facilitation live sessions such as future demo sessions.
02:24:40	Ravi:	Replying to "@Bhanu Anishetty  - ..."

This idea is only for demo hopefully , else Ali would get some ideas for next cohort to pass this test first before completion or certification. Those guys would complain, Cohort-1 passed and then created this gate check for next batches lol
