Title: Thinking and Reasoning LLMs

This lecture explores reasoning-focused LLMs and how they achieve stronger problem-solving through inference-time and training-time techniques. We examine approaches like chain-of-thought, self-consistency, tree search, reward modeling, and self-refinement, along with recent models that internalize search.

Learning Objectives:

Understand the landscape of reasoning models, including OpenAI’s “o” family and DeepSeek-R1

Learn inference-time methods such as chain-of-thought prompting, self-consistency, sequential revision, tree of thoughts, and verifier-guided search

Study training-time strategies, including supervised finetuning on reasoning data, reinforcement learning with verifiers, reward modeling, and self-refinement

Explore emerging directions like Meta-CoT and the internalization of search within reasoning models
