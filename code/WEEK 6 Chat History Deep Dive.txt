How about we continue the Saturday 10AM PST sessions for weeks after the cohort end and each we we go by the sequential order in the Capstone signup sheet and teams showcase their work.   Hi @AlexXu,  @Ali Aminian , @Theresa@ByteByteGo  let me know if this sounds good, and if you can keep the logistics for that.
01:11:48	Roy's Notetaker (Otter.ai):	Hi, I'm an AI assistant helping Roy Seto take notes for this meeting. Follow along the transcript here:  https://otter.ai/u/s4qVCkiScDqPSvRQr37bmh8G51w?utm_source=va_chat_link_1

01:25:19	Prasad:	Replying to "Why do need we need ..."

@Rahul Kulkarni -Selecting a GPU runtime only makes a GPU available—it does not move your model or tensors onto the GPU.
You must still call .to("cuda") (or .cuda()) explicitly because PyTorch never automatically decides device placement for you.

maybe you can watch the deep dive record and find answers from there?
01:34:53	Prasad:	Replying to "Why do need we need ..."

@Craig – From what I understand, modern GPUs aren’t plugged directly into the motherboard. They come on a graphics card that includes the GPU chip, memory, power circuitry, and cooling, and the whole card goes into a PCIe slot. I’ve never seen a bare GPU chip plugged in by itself.
That said, this is just based on my limited knowledge—happy to hear your perspective.

01:51:50	Dylan Thomas:	My mental model for Huggingface is like GitHub: models are open {weight|source} in the sense that the weights are open, but you still have to pay attention to the license that it’s released under. Like GPL for software would mean you’d have to release your modifications to weights back to open source, whereas MIT would let you adapt and use for internal project without having to release your mods.  I think :-)

It looks like in future, Intel is collaborating with Nvidia to come up with hardware designs where the CPU and GPU will interconnect with NVLink instead of PCI-E, but nothing out yet.  Who knows if/when that will come out, and if Intel will be around in 5 years. 😂

Or we could buy a DGX spark to connect remotely to H100/A100 GPUs and run heavier AI workloads with a Decent local GPU. Like we write code locally, DGX spark runs the code remotely on a DGX H100 GPU, can perform inference and training remotely and output results back to our local machine.
02:04:44	Prasad:	@Ali - In Exercise 2.3, we experimented with num_inference_steps. The documentation says more steps = better quality but slower. Is there a 'sweet spot' number, or does it depend on the model/prompt? How do you decide?"

https://writeonsaga.com/  allows you to write a script, and it generates a movie.  The target market is writers who want to pitch screenplays to Hollywood studios.
https://cloudglue.dev/  , can analyze videos and do things like search, RAG

@Craig Rodrigues Thanks! My plan: 

Fall 2025 (now)
Hands-on AI upskilling (like this excellent course)
Nurture & broaden network

Early 2026: Shift more energy to top-of-funnel lead generation (for a full-time role as a staff+ engineer or EM/eng director at a B2B enterprise growth-stage startup)

I saw that the Colab Pro Compute Units expires in 3 months. I didn’t purchase because I didn’t understand how much say 100 compute units will get me in terms of hours or specific usage. If I move my other AI projects (not from this class) to run on my computer, (not Colab), I should look into renting GPU. Therefore, I didn’t upgrade to Colab Pro yet.  Good to know that you paid for Colab Pro and it works for you. Project 5 is a great lesson for me to learn how time consuming and unexpected hurddles I can face when playing with T2I and T2V models.

It kept failing few times with GPU error. So I paid $10 under assumption that it should help run the models quickly.

I haven’t tried it, but one of my friends has a startup where he rents out GPUs.  It is more barebones than Colab, but is cheaper, and I think you can get some free credits to try it out at first:

I ran into issues running both the week 3 and week 4 projects on my machine since it's old, so I ended up running them on Colab. However, basic Colab subscription requires environment setup cells to be run every time I sat down to complete the exercises. Since the dependencies keep upgrading, I constantly worked on resolving package compatibility errors. It seems like renting a GPU would make the development experience smoother.

@Ikee system design and ML are pretty good too, some feel they don’t go deep enough, but there’s still value

I am trying to pull all the linkedin URLs with a script. Some seem to be available right on the intro page and some under the *see more* button. I will share a plain text link of all the linked IN urls from intro page and update the list in the general discussion forum.

Adding 434 links to any group might be a task in itself. We will need to automate this 😁

03:42:26	Roy Seto:	Everyone: Please consider joining the new private unlisted LinkedIn group I just created for students in Cohort 1 to stay in touch after this course ends. 

https://www.linkedin.com/groups/16265002/ 

Private LinkedIn group for students in ByteByteAI Cohort 1 (Oct-Nov 2025). 

Let's use this group to stay in touch after the course, both to share AI learnings and to build a network to help each other as AI builders in our careers!

Joining will require admin approval. That’s me for now (will welcome help). I have to run- will review and approve tomorrow morning

@Maggie Zhao can you post this link on Circle now?

Maggie - With the announcement blurb above would be great
03:46:46	perry sy:	Replying to "Everyone: Please c..."

I think we should share it in the community channel since many folks have already left the session.
03:47:41	Roy Seto:	Replying to "Everyone: Please con..."

@perry sy agree
03:49:01	Bhanu Anishetty:	Replying to "I’m creating a priva..."

I think it is better to just create the group and let everyone join the group themselves and then go private once we are done.
03:49:16	Mikhail Kuzmin:	Reacted to "Everyone: Please c..." with ❤️
03:50:00	Bhanu Anishetty:	Replying to "I’m creating a priva..."

I created one here: (13) ByteByteAI Engineering Cohort Group - 10/04/2025 | Groups | LinkedIn we can go private and add more admins as we go.
03:50:11	Roy Seto:	Replying to "I’m creating a priva..."

@Bhanu Anishetty LinkedIn does not allow the private/public flag for groups to be changed after creation

Am I missing something @Roy Seto?
03:52:30	Bhanu Anishetty:	Replying to "I’m creating a priva..."

We can move from LISTED=>UNLISTED and also uncheck "Allow members to invite their connections" once the cohort group joins.
03:53:02	Kevin Lu:	Thank you so much Ali and everyone!
03:53:09	Sandeep Raikar:	Thanks a lot Ali and everyone
03:53:28	Ravi:	Replying to "I’m creating a priva..."

Lets follow and join one LN groups ( as folks would get split otherwise and gets difficult to merge later)
03:53:36	Roy Seto:	Replying to "I’m creating a priva..."

@Bhanu Anishetty - according to my Perplexity Pro research and what I think I saw on the LI UI when I created the group, it’s NOT POSSIBLE to change a group from public to private later
