It looks like he’s using ollama, which runs locally on his own machine.  Any server running locally on your machine will have the url:

http://localhost:xxxx 

Those numbers after the ‘:’ are the port, and you can set those yourself, but local servers tend to have preset ports that they default to.  Because of that, he knew what port to use.

I’m liking vs code with normal autocomplete, and then Claude code via command line.  That’s just the sweet spot for my brain right now.  I’m sure I’ll change with time.  For some reason though, my brain is finding it easier to just “slap on another tool’, instead of changing (too much at once) the tool I’m used to using.

I had to upgrade my default SSD too, just to fit the ever increasing number of models that I am having to install locally. And ollama by default installs on your OS (C) drive, and would not let you install to *a drive you want* on your machine. You could technically copy the models yourself to another drive but you will also end up creating PATH variable to point another drive. The largest model so far in this course is deepseek, its around 5.2 GB

00:32:17	Andrew Harasymiw:	Replying to "I’m still fine with ..."

I would assume that we just don’t need langchain for this.  We’ve used it before in situations where we may not strictly need it, but that was so we could get used to using it.  

Since we’re really zooming in on thinking and reasoning this week, removing that extra piece (langchain) can help us focus on which pieces are important for this topic.

I’m not saying that’s the answer.  I’m saying that’s my guess 😛

Langchain seems to come in best when you want to to hook up to a bunch of llamas, some locally some not.

00:33:07	Andrew Harasymiw:	Replying to "I’m still fine with ..."

Here we just need to hook up to one at a time, and only try out a few, all of which can likely be run locally (one that’s good at thinking, one that’s not, one that’s low power, and one that’s high power). Then we can see which of them does best.

A somewhat old school answer here:

I have seen Apache TIKA being successfully used for document parsing. It’s free so great to get started with.

However it is not clear if it is meaningful for AI applications as well. The output of Apache TIKA is pure text.
